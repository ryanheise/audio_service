# audio_service

Play audio in the background.

* Continues playing while the screen is off or the app is in the background
* Control playback from your Flutter UI, notifications, lock screen, headset, Wear OS or Android Auto
* Drive audio playback from Dart code

This plugin wraps around your existing Dart audio code to allow it to run in the background, and also respond to media button clicks on the lock screen, notifications, control center, headphone buttons and other supported remote control devices. This is necessary for a whole range of media applications such as music and podcast players, text-to-speech readers, navigators, etc.

This plugin is audio agnostic. It is designed to allow you to use your favourite audio plugins, such as [just_audio](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/just_audio), [flutter_radio](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_radio), [flutter_tts](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_tts), and others. It simply wraps a special isolate around your existing audio code so that it can run in the background and enable remote control interfaces.

Note that because your app's UI and your background audio task will run in separate isolates, they do not share memory. They communicate through the message passing APIs provided by audio_service.

**NEW**: This release includes a partially working "alpha" iOS implementation. If you'd like to help with any missing features, join us on [GitHub issue #10](https://github.com/ryanheise/audio_service/issues/10).

## Example

audio_service provides two sets of APIs: one for your main UI isolate (`AudioService`), and one for your background audio isolate (`AudioServiceBackground`).

### UI code

This code runs in the main UI isolate:

```dart
AudioService.connect();    // When UI becomes visible
AudioService.start(        // When user clicks button to start playback
  backgroundTaskEntrypoint: myBackgroundTaskEntrypoint,
  androidNotificationChannelName: 'Music Player',
  androidNotificationIcon: "mipmap/ic_launcher",
);
AudioService.pause();      // When user clicks button to pause playback
AudioService.play();       // When user clicks button to resume playback
AudioService.disconnect(); // When UI is gone
```

The full example on GitHub should be consulted for tips on how to hook `connect` and `disconnect` into your widget's lifecycle.

### Background code

This code runs in a background isolate, and is the code that is guaranteed to continue running even if your UI is gone:

```dart
void myBackgroundTaskEntrypoint() {
  AudioServiceBackground.run(() => MyBackgroundTask());
}

class MyBackgroundTask extends BackgroundAudioTask {
  @override
  Future<void> onStart() async {
    // Your custom dart code to start audio playback.
    // NOTE: The background audio task will shut down
    // as soon as this async function completes.
  }
  @override
  void onStop() {
    // Your custom dart code to stop audio playback.
  }
  @override
  void onPlay() {
    // Your custom dart code to resume audio playback.
  }
  @override
  void onPause() {
    // Your custom dart code to pause audio playback.
  }
  @override
  void onClick(MediaButton button) {
    // Your custom dart code to handle a media button click.
  }
}
```
The full example on GitHub demonstrates how to fill in these callbacks to do audio playback and also text-to-speech. Note that the entry point is also run in the background isolate, and therefore must be a static or top level method, as shown.

## Android setup

1. You will need to create a custom `MainApplication` class as follows:

```java
// Insert your package name here instead of com.example.yourpackagename.
// You can find your package name at the top of your AndroidManifest file
// after package="...
package com.example.yourpackagename;

import io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry;
import io.flutter.app.FlutterApplication;
import io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant;
import com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioServicePlugin;

public class MainApplication extends FlutterApplication implements PluginRegistry.PluginRegistrantCallback {
  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    AudioServicePlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback(this);
  }

  @Override
  public void registerWith(PluginRegistry registry) {
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(registry);
  }
}
```

2. Edit your project's `AndroidManifest.xml` file to reference your `MainApplication` class, declare the permission to create a wake lock, and add component entries for the `<service>` and `<receiver>`:

```xml
<manifest ...>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
  
  <application
    android:name=".MainApplication"
    ...>
    
    ...
    
    <service android:name="com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioService">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.media.browse.MediaBrowserService" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>

    <receiver android:name="androidx.media.session.MediaButtonReceiver" >
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
      </intent-filter>
    </receiver> 
  </application>
</manifest>
```

3. Any icons that you want to appear in the notification (see the `MediaControl` class) should be defined as Android resources in `android/app/src/main/res`. Here you will find a subdirectory for each different resolution:

```
drawable-hdpi
drawable-mdpi
drawable-xhdpi
drawable-xxhdpi
drawable-xxxhdpi
```

You can use [Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/) to generate these different subdirectories for any standard material design icon.

Starting from Flutter 1.12, you will also need to disable the `shrinkResources` setting in your `android/app/build.gradle` file, otherwise your icon resources will be removed during the build:

```
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28

    ...

    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig ...
            shrinkResources false // ADD THIS LINE
        }
    }
}
```

*NOTE: Most Flutter plugins today were written before Flutter added support for running Dart code in a headless environment (without an Android Activity present). As such, a number of plugins assume there is an activity and run into a `NullPointerException`. Fortunately, it is very easy for plugin authors to update their plugins remove this assumption. If you encounter such a plugin, see the bottom of this README file for a sample bug report you can send to the relevant plugin author.*

## iOS setup

Insert this in your `Info.plist` file:

```
	<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
	<array>
		<string>audio</string>
	</array>
```

The example project may be consulted for context.

### Sample bug report

If you encounter a Flutter plugin that gives a `NullPointerException` on Android, it is likely that the plugin has assumed the existence of an activity when there is none. If that is the case, you can submit a bug report to the author of that plugin and suggest the simple fix that should get it to work.

Here is a sample bug report.

> Flutter's new background execution feature (described here: https://medium.com/flutter-io/executing-dart-in-the-background-with-flutter-plugins-and-geofencing-2b3e40a1a124) allows plugins to be registered in a background context (e.g. a Service). The problem is that the wifi plugin assumes that the context for plugin registration is an activity with this line of code:
> 
> `    WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) registrar.activity().getApplicationContext().getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);`
> 
> `registrar.activity()` may now return null, and this leads to a `NullPointerException`:
> 
> ```
> E/AndroidRuntime( 2453):   at com.ly.wifi.WifiPlugin.registerWith(WifiPlugin.java:23)
> E/AndroidRuntime( 2453):   at io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java:30)
> ```
> 
> The solution is to change the above line of code to this:
> 
> `    WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) registrar.activeContext().getApplicationContext().getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);`
